SkinModPy 
===
## Info
SkinModPy is a program you can use to easily add accessories, clothing, and more to your skin.

So, for example, you can give your skin a chrismas hat.

Its main use is for events like christmas, to give your skin a cool christmas vibe.

## Installation
You can either install the executable from the releases tab, or install the source and run it with the python interpreter.

### Downloading From Releases
If you are on windows, you are able to download from a release. 

However, if you use Linux or macOS, you will need to compile from source.

### Running From Source
**You will need**
* [Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/) *or later*
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

**How To**
You will need to execute these commands in order to successfully clone the repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/talwat/SkinModPy
cd SkinModPy
```
Then, you will need to install the dependencies.

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Finally, to run the program, do:

* **MAC & LINUX** `python src/main.py`

* **WINDOWS** `py src/main.py`

Or, if you want to build it as a binary, you can run the apropriate script in the `scripts` folder.

## Contribution
I dont really want code contributions due to how small this program is.

However, if you want to add a built in overlay, you can message me on discord `Talwat#2277` with the png of the overlay you would like to add.

I will make a guide to making a custom overlay eventually.
