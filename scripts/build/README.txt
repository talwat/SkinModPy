Build Scripts
    The build scripts require pyinstaller, it can be installed with pip.
    Also, on linux and osx, python3 should be replaced with your interpreter name of choice. (Eg, python, python3.10, python3.9)
    WARNING: I would not reccomend building on osx and linux, as pyinstaller is a little weird on both. You will need to tweak the script.
